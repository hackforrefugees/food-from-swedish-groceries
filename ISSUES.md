Right now the main issues is our lack of understanding of how the backend
actually functions at the moment. The priority features to implement
is synchronization between different language recipe datbases, making
addition of a new language dynamic instead of manually creating a new database
and the associated queueries and so forth. We also need to implement
a ingredient database and propely integrate this into the UI so that it
is searchable and easily manageable for translators.

After this the sky is the limit I suppose, but when these features are implemented
I think we have a pretty solid 1.0 release.
