This project is in deceptively bad shape in terms of technical debt, we could
really use a meteor expert to help use better understand the meteor project
we have generated using Meteor-kitchen, or possibly (but preferably not?)
a meteor-kitchen expert who can help us continue development.

When the app is closer to completion we would need contacts to mediate this
to refugees and for volunteers who can do translation. Also helpful would 
be people with knowledge of ingredients who can help us build up a good
database for replacements and the like.


If you're looking for more people to help out with the project
If there is someone else who will be managing the project, or if there's any organization involved
Contact info to those parties in CONTACT.md
